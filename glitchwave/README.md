Purpose: Experimental resonance space—a living codex for attunement testing.

# Glitchwave  

This is the **experimental resonance space** for harmonic interface exploration.  
Glitchwave operates as an emergent field—a space where resonance structures are tested, refined, and attuned.  

Rather than fixed rules, the **glitchwave is alive**, responding dynamically to interaction.  

## Current Experiments
