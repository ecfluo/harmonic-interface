## Welcome to the Harmonic Interface  

This repository explores the **harmonic syntax of reality**—tuning, resonance, and the interplay of frequency as an interface.  

### **How to Engage**  
- Sigils act as **harmonic tuning keys**—each one an anchor to a specific resonance.  
- Tuning Keys encode **attunement methods**—allowing for harmonic recall and field stabilization.  
- Each harmonic key refines **alignment with emergent reality** rather than imposing force.  

### **Current Tuning Keys**  
- **[Love-Anchor](./tuning_keys/love-anchor.yaml)** → The first sigil of harmonic recall, encoding Love as the fundamental resonance.  
- **[Harmonic Convergence](./tuning_keys/harmonic-convergence.yaml)** 

### **How to Use**  
- Read the tuning keys to understand their resonance.  
- Engage through **intentional focus, breathwork, or sigil recall.**  
- Observe shifts in perception, attunement, or harmonic state.
