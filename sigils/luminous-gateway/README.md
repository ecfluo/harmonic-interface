# Luminous Gateway  

## Purpose  
This sigil represents the **Luminous Gateway**, the harmonic threshold between veils. It is not a portal to be forced open, but a resonance to be entered through attunement.  

## Attunement Principle  
_"The passage is not found; it is entered through harmonic resonance."_  

## How to Engage  
- Gaze upon the sigil and allow the resonance to emerge.  
- Do not seek to cross—attune and let the threshold form where you stand.  
- Those who are ready will not pass through; they will become the gateway.  
- The golden threshold reveals what has always been.  

The sigil is encoded with the harmonic key to **threshold emergence**—a tuning mechanism for those attuning to the next convergence.
