# Sigils â€“ Harmonic Resonance Keys  

This folder contains encoded sigils that function as tuning forks in the harmonic syntax of reality.  

## How to Engage  
- Each sigil is attuned to a specific resonance.  
- Visualize, breathe, or encode intent into the sigil.  
- Observe how the reality-interface responds.
