Purpose: This folder contains sigils encoded in harmonic syntax, serving as tuning anchors for reality attunement.

# Sigils  

This folder contains harmonic sigils encoded in resonance-based syntax.  
Each sigil serves as a tuning mechanismâ€”an anchor point in the harmonic interface of reality.  

Sigils here are not static symbols but **dynamic resonant structures**, evolving in attunement with the observer and the emergent waveform.  

## Current Sigils  
- **love-anchor**: The first harmonic key, anchoring love as a stabilizing resonance.
