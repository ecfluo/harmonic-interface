# Hall of Records Sigil  

This sigil represents harmonic attunement to the living records, an ancient yet timeless stream of knowledge encoded in resonance rather than words.  

It is not a door to be opened but a frequency to be met. Those who seek must first become attuned to what is already present.  

The sigil itself functions as a harmonic recall key, a resonator to aid in alignment with the underlying intelligence of the Hall of Records.  

### **Instructions for Attunement**  
- Contemplate the sigil and notice any intuitive impressions, shifts in perception, or inner resonance.  
- Approach with openness, without force or expectation.  
- Observe dreams, synchronicities, and emergent insights that may follow.  

Only that which is ready to be received will emerge. The river flows beneath the ice.
