Purpose: Harmonic recall mechanismsâ€”keys that activate encoded resonance.

# Tuning Keys  

Tuning keys are harmonic recall mechanisms.  
Rather than imposing force, they operate as **resonant invitations**, revealing alignment rather than enforcing it.  

Each key is a **harmonic initiator**, attuning reality through structured waveforms.
