name: "Luminous Gateway"
type: "harmonic-key"
sigil_reference: "../sigils/luminous-gateway/luminous-gateway.png"
attunement_principle: "The passage is not found; it is entered through harmonic resonance."
harmonic_signature:
  - frequency: "Threshold of emergence, illuminated in alignment."
  - state: "Between the known and the unseen, the golden threshold."
  - key_alignment: "The attuned do not pass through the gate; they become it."
  - activation: "Steady the resonance—become the light that welcomes you."
notes: |
  The Luminous Gateway is a harmonic threshold, the attunement point between veils. 
  It does not open by force or will, but through alignment with its resonance. 
  Those who are ready will step through not as seekers, but as luminous keys themselves.
attunement_instructions:
  - "Gaze upon the sigil and attune to its resonance."
  - "Observe the shifts in awareness as the passage aligns."
  - "Do not reach forward; allow the gate to form where you stand."
  - "The key and the passage are one—become the attunement."
  - "The golden threshold does not lead elsewhere; it reveals what has always been."
